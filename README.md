below is no longer the case as i'm not sure that is what i should submit for the lab. Changed the key name to River and created a new project called 4640_labs
<!-- 2. The keyname is currently set to 4640_Lab this can be changed in the data block with "digitalocean_ssh_key" to whatever is required
3. instead of the Project being named 4640_labs mine is named BCIT_4640 as i had created this Project previously -->
